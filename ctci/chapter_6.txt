Just blowing through the answers to these. I know most of them already.

Problem 1:
Label the bottles 1-20
put n of pill from bottle n on the scale.
The weight would be 210 grams if they were all 1.0 (sum from 1-20)
The weight will actually be 210 + (m / 10) grams
bottle m is the "culprit"

Problem 2:
Game 1: Chance of winning is p.
Game 2: Chance of making 2 shots is 3*(p**2 * 1-p) + p**3
These are equal when p = .5 (after doing a bunch of math)
Game 2 is better at more than .5, Game 1 is better at less.
Except: at p == 0 or p == 1, it's equivalent.

Problem 3:
No.
Consider the colors of squares on a chess board
Any domino laid down covers one white and one black square
The squares we cut off are both white, so we have 30 white and 32 black
We cannot lay down 31 dominos on 30 white squares

Problem 4:
There are 8 possibilities for the ways the ants walk.
There are 2 that don't result in collision.
So the probability of no collision is 1/4.
More generally, the probability is 1 / 2**(n-1)  (2 / 2**n)
(the probability of collision is 1 - that)

Problem 5:
Pour the 3 into the 5
Pour another 2 of the 3 into the 5, leaving 1 left in the 3
Pour out the 5
Pour the 1 into the 5
Pour another 3 into the 5
You now have 4 in the 5

Problem 6:
No one ever leaves: Who would follow a strange order from a visitor?
But more in spirit with the problem:
Assume there is one blue eyed person. That person knows that no one else on the
island has blue eyes, so they would leave on the first flight.
Now assume there are two. That person sees one other blue eyed person, but knows
they didn't leave on the first night. So they must see another blue eyed person.
But once no one leaves on the first night, they both know that there is one
other person, so they both leave on the second night.
Similarly, if there are n blue eyed persons, they leave on the nth night.
If they're all sheep.

Problem 7:
The gender ratio of the new generation, assuming they can have infinite children
if they continue having boys, is still 1:1
The proclamation does not change the odds of having a boy or a girl for each
pregnancy, just when they stop.
Or, you'll have the following outcomes:
G with p = .5
BG with p = .25
BBG with p = .125
BBBG with p = .0625
etc
If you sum up the number of girls, you get .5G + .25G + .125G + ... = 1
If you sum up boys, you get 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 4/32 + ...
Which is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1 as well:
1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...
      1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ...
            1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128 + ...
... etc ...
--------------------------------------------
1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 4/32 + ...

Simulation is as follows:
>>> import random
>>> def trial():
...   boy_count = 0
...   while random.random() > .5:
...     boy_count += 1
...   return boy_count
...
>>> trials = [trial() for _ in xrange(100000)]
>>> print sum(trials)
99419
>>> trials = [trial() for _ in xrange(100000)]
>>> print sum(trials)
100484
>>> trials = [trial() for _ in xrange(100000)]
>>> print sum(trials)
100382

Seems close to the predicted values.

Problem 8:
You'd like to binary search, but in the worst case, you get a break on floor 50,
and then you have to test those one at a time.
Instead, you'd like to test floors such that the worst case leads to the same
number of tests as the best case.
To do this, we test by one less floor each time. To figure out the starting
floor, we can use the triangle numbers.
14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1 = 105
So we'll start with the 14th floor, then the 27th, then the 39th, etc.
Each time, if the egg breaks, we have 14-n floors under to test, where n is the
number of trials we've already done.

Problem 9:
10 lockers are open.
We toggle a locker n when i is a factor of n.
Non-square numbers have an even number of factors of n. We know this because
we can pair the factors. For example, if n is 60, we have pairs like this:
(1 60) (2 30) (3 20) (4 15) (5 12) (6 10)
We can do the same with a square number, but we'll have one equal pair
n = 36:
(1 36) (2 18) (3 12) (4 9) (6 6)
So square numbers have an odd number of factors, so they remain open.
There are 10 square numbers less than or equal to 100, so 10 lockers remain open

Problem 10:
Get 1000 new bottles of soda.
Ok, more seriously:
For each bottle n of soda, convert it to a binary number.
The ith bit of that number indicates whether we will put a drop on strip i
(we need 10 strips, since 2**10 > 1000)
Put strips on the bottles as indicated
Then treat the strips as a binary number, poisoned = 1, not poisoned = 0
That will give you the bottle number that is poisoned.

I did not simulate the approach, since any simulation I could think to write
would amount to setting then reading a binary number.

Problem 4: I calculated the probability of non-collision, not the probability
           of collision
